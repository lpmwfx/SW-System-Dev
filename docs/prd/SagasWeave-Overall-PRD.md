# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - SagasWeave Platform

## 1. Introduction

SagasWeave is an innovative platform designed to empower authors and creators in developing, managing, and publishing interactive narratives and game content. It aims to streamline the creative process through intelligent automation, AI assistance, and a modular, scalable architecture. This document outlines the high-level product requirements for the entire SagasWeave ecosystem.

## 2. Overall Goals

-   **Empower Creators**: Provide a robust and intuitive environment for authors to craft complex narratives and game worlds.
-   **Automate Workflows**: Minimize manual effort in content management, transformation, and publishing through intelligent automation.
-   **Leverage AI**: Integrate AI seamlessly to assist with content generation, validation, refactoring, and creative suggestions.
-   **Ensure Quality & Consistency**: Maintain high standards for content quality, code integrity, and project structure across the platform.
-   **Facilitate Publishing**: Enable efficient and multi-platform publishing of interactive content.
-   **Scalability & Maintainability**: Build a modular and maintainable system capable of evolving with future needs and technologies.

## 3. User Roles and Journeys

### 3.1. The Author/Creator

**User Journey: Content Creation & Collaboration**

1.  **Mobile Content Creation**: The author uses mobile devices (iPad or iPhone) with applications like Obsidian or Textastic to write and develop narrative content.
2.  **Synchronization**: Content is saved and synchronized to the `SW-Book` repository, typically via a tool like WorkingCopy, ensuring mobile-first content input.
3.  **Mac-based Automation**: On a Mac, the author initiates system processes using `npm` automation within the `SW-System` to collaborate on content, trigger transformations, and prepare for publishing.
4.  **Future Vision (VPS Automation)**: The system will evolve to run fully automatically on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), allowing for continuous content processing and publishing without direct manual intervention.
5.  **App Content Review**: The author reviews the processed and integrated content within the `SW-App` (the final product/application) to ensure satisfaction with the presentation and functionality.
6.  **App Publication**: Once satisfied, the author triggers the publication process using GitHub CI/CD pipelines, deploying the `SW-App` according to its defined tech stack.

### 3.2. The Developer

-   **System Development**: Works within `SW-System` to build and maintain the core engine, automation scripts, and shared services.
-   **App Development**: Focuses on `SW-App` to develop the user-facing application, UI, and interactive elements.
-   **Book Tooling Development**: Contributes to `SW-Book` by developing specialized tools for content creation, management, and publishing automation.

## 4. High-Level Features

### 4.1. Content Creation & Management (SW-Book)
-   Text-first authoring environment (Markdown/MDX).
-   Narrative structuring (plot, characters, world-building).
-   AI-assisted writing and content generation.
-   Version control for narrative assets.

### 4.2. Core System & Automation (SW-System)
-   Centralized engine for shared services and automation.
-   Code quality enforcement and transformation tools.
-   MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) services for AI integration.
-   Project initialization and configuration management.

### 4.3. User-Facing Application (SW-App)
-   Interactive display of published narratives and game content.
-   User interface for content consumption and interaction.
-   Integration with core system services for dynamic content.

### 4.4. Publishing & Deployment
-   Automated content transformation to various output formats.
-   CI/CD pipelines for `SW-App` deployment.
-   Integration with publishing platforms.

## 5. High-Level Architecture

SagasWeave follows a modular, repository-based architecture:

-   **`SW-System`**: The core engine. Provides foundational services, development automation, and shared utilities to other components. It is designed for reusability and consistency.
-   **`SW-Book`**: The content creation and publishing hub. Contains narrative assets, authoring tools, and publishing automation specific to content creators.
-   **`SW-App`**: The end-user application. Consumes content processed by `SW-Book` and services provided by `SW-System` to deliver the interactive experience.
-   **`SW-System-Dev`**: The development environment and documentation repository. Houses project-level documentation (PRDs, design docs), sprint plans, and development-specific configurations.

## 6. High-Level Technology Stack

-   **Core Development**: Node.js, TypeScript
-   **Content Authoring**: Markdown/MDX, potentially Obsidian/Textastic integration
-   **Frontend**: React (for `SW-App`)
-   **Automation/Tooling**: `npm` scripts, AST-grep, Comby, Biome, Vitest, MCP Servers
-   **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
-   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
-   **Deployment**: VPS (for future automated system), potentially static hosting for `SW-App`

## 7. Deployment and Maintenance Considerations

-   **CI/CD**: Implement robust GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment of `SW-App` and potentially `SW-System` services.
-   **VPS Hosting**: Design `SW-System` for headless operation on a VPS for continuous, automated content processing.
-   **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for system health and content processing pipelines.
-   **Security**: Ensure secure handling of content, user data, and deployment credentials.

## 8. Future Considerations

-   Advanced AI models for deeper narrative analysis and generation.
-   Expanded platform integrations for publishing and distribution.
-   Community features for authors and readers.
-   Multi-language support for content and platform.
