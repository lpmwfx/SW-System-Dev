# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - SagasWeave Development Environment & UX

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for the SagasWeave development environment, with a particular focus on User Experience (UX) for creators and developers. The goal is to create an intuitive, efficient, and AI-assisted workflow for narrative development.

## 2. Goals
-   **Streamline Narrative Authoring**: Enable creators to write complex narratives with ease using a text-first approach.
-   **Enhance Developer Productivity**: Provide tools and automation that reduce boilerplate and enforce consistency.
-   **Leverage AI Effectively**: Integrate AI as a seamless assistant for content generation, validation, and refactoring.
-   **Ensure Consistency & Quality**: Maintain high standards for code quality, naming conventions, and project structure.
-   **Provide Clear Feedback**: Offer immediate and actionable feedback to users on their input and the system's actions.

## 3. Target Audience
-   **Narrative Designers/Writers**: Individuals focused on crafting stories, characters, and world-building.
-   **Game Developers**: Programmers implementing game logic, UI, and integrations.
-   **AI Developers**: Engineers working on AI models and their integration into the SagasWeave ecosystem.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1. Text-First Authoring Environment
-   **Markdown Editor**: A rich Markdown editing experience with syntax highlighting for `::TAGs::` and other SagasWeave-specific syntax.
-   **Semantic Tagging**: Easy insertion and management of semantic tags for defining narrative elements, UI components, and logic hooks.
-   **Naming Convention Enforcement**: Real-time feedback and automated suggestions/corrections for naming based on `sw-naming-book.json`.

### 4.2. AI-Assisted Workflow
-   **AI Content Generation**: Tools for generating narrative snippets, character descriptions, or dialogue based on prompts.
-   **AI Validation & Correction**: AI-powered linting and validation of Markdown structure and semantic tag usage, with suggestions for fixes.
-   **AI Refactoring**: Automated refactoring tools for code and narrative elements, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.
-   **AI as Fallback**: When manual input is ambiguous or incomplete, AI should intelligently fill gaps or suggest alternatives.

### 4.3. Command Line Interface (CLI) & MCP Server Integration
-   **Intuitive CLI Commands**: Simple and consistent CLI commands for compiling, validating, testing, and deploying SagasWeave projects.
-   **MCP Server Interaction**: Seamless integration with the MCP server for background tasks, long-running processes, and advanced AI operations.
-   **Real-time Feedback**: CLI commands should provide clear, concise, and real-time output on their progress and any errors.

### 4.4. Project Structure & Management
-   **Clear Separation**: Strict separation between core product files (`SW-AIdriven`) and development/experimental files (`SW-AIdriven-dev`).
-   **Automated Project Setup**: Tools for quickly setting up new SagasWeave projects with the correct structure and initial configurations.
-   **Version Control Integration**: Designed for seamless integration with Git for collaborative development and version tracking.

## 5. User Experience (UX) Principles

### 5.1. Simplicity & Clarity
-   **Minimalist Interface**: Focus on essential tools and information, avoiding clutter.
-   **Clear Language**: Use straightforward and unambiguous language in all UI elements, error messages, and documentation.
-   **Predictable Interactions**: Actions should have predictable outcomes, reducing cognitive load.

### 5.2. Efficiency & Productivity
-   **Fast Feedback Loops**: Provide immediate feedback on user actions, compilation errors, and validation issues.
-   **Automation**: Automate repetitive and error-prone tasks (e.g., naming, code generation, validation).
-   **Keyboard-Centric Workflow**: Support keyboard shortcuts and command-line interactions for power users.

### 5.3. Learnability & Discoverability
-   **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complex features gradually as users become more proficient.
-   **Contextual Help**: Provide help and documentation relevant to the current task or context.
-   **Intuitive Naming**: Command names, file names, and folder structures should be intuitive and reflect their purpose.

### 5.4. Consistency
-   **Unified Design Language**: Maintain a consistent visual and interaction design across all tools and interfaces.
-   **Standardized Workflows**: Establish clear and repeatable workflows for common tasks.
-   **Adherence to Conventions**: Strictly follow naming, coding, and documentation conventions.

### 5.5. Error Prevention & Recovery
-   **Proactive Validation**: Catch potential errors early in the development process (e.g., during typing, on save).
-   **Clear Error Messages**: Provide descriptive and actionable error messages that guide users to a solution.
-   **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Support robust undo/redo for critical operations.

## 6. Technical Requirements (UX-related)
-   **Responsive Design**: CLI output and any potential future UI components should be readable and usable across different terminal sizes.
-   **Performance**: Tools and processes should be highly performant to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
-   **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility standards for all interfaces.

## 7. Future Considerations
-   **Visual Editor**: A potential future visual editor that complements the text-first approach, offering a graphical representation of the narrative flow and UI.
-   **Integrated Debugging**: Enhanced debugging tools specifically tailored for SagasWeave narratives and generated code.
